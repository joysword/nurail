This NURail GIS Project began with the development of the Sustainability Checklist for rail infrastructure. Based on the metrics incorporated in the Checklist, a GIS-based planning database was constructed. The Checklist has been designed to align with U.S. DOT’s strategic goals and the <i><a href="http://www.dot.state.il.us/green/documents/I-LASTGuidebook.pdf" target="_blank"> Illinois Livable and Sustainable Transportation Rating System and Guide (“I-LAST”)</a></i>.

<b>NURail Sustainability Checklist:</b></br>
<p>
The Sustainability Checklist provides a systems-based view of rail transport and incorporates state-of-the-art academic research findings, legislation and government guidelines in a comprehensive document. The project has been designed to align with U.S. DOT’s strategic goals: Livable Communities, Safety, Equity and Environmental Sustainability . While this research is limited to the scope of Illinois, the generic framework may be replicable in other regions.  
</p>
</br>





<p>
The database currently includes base data and advanced data layers. Base data layers are compiled from existing data provided by multiple agencies, such as DOT, EPA, FRA, and AAR . Advanced data layers, such as air emissions and risks, are modeled and created by <a href="OurTeam.html" target="_blank">our team</a>. 
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>NURail Interactive Map:</b></br>

The database currently includes rail operations, infrastructure and maintenance data; demographics; and land use data. A future version of the database will include meteorological, geologic and benchmarking data. A rail emissions impact analysis model was integrated into the GIS database to visualize air emissions at specific locations along the rail network. Finally, this GIS-based web interface will include a platform to allow users to provide inputs for project-specific impact assessment.
